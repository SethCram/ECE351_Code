# Any other necessary information needed to navigate the file #
# 
#   What did you do over last summer, or what are you planning to do this upcoming summer?
#       Over last summer I spent most of my time with my family, taught myself how to use 
#       the Unity Game Engine, C# and the basics of 3d modeling in Blender.     
#
#   What do you personally want to get out of this lab?
#       I want improved coding skills in Python considering how widely used it is in 
#       industry.
